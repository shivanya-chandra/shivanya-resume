      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Purdue University who enjoys building
        software that is both technically sound and genuinely useful. I’m especially interested in full-stack
        development and systems where performance, usability, and scalability all matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across internships, university roles, and team projects, I’ve worked on problems that required turning
        ambiguous requirements into clear implementations, collaborating with others, and making thoughtful
        engineering tradeoffs. I value clean code, strong fundamentals, and building tools that people can trust.

      <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Collegify — College Planning Platform</h3>
        <p>
          Collegify was designed to help students navigate the college application process using data-driven
          recommendations. The platform considers academic performance, financial constraints, and personal
          interests to suggest schools that align with a student’s goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked across the full stack, integrating a TensorFlow-based recommendation engine while ensuring
          that results were interpretable and user-friendly. This project strengthened my ability to balance
          model accuracy with usability and explain technical decisions clearly.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>TrainHer — Self-Defense Training App</h3>
        <p>
          Built during a hackathon, TrainHer uses camera-based motion tracking to provide real-time feedback
          on self-defense techniques. The goal was to make training more accessible and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on motion tracking logic, Firebase authentication, and real-time feedback delivery.
          The project placed second among 30+ teams and emphasized rapid prototyping under time constraints.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>BoilerFind — Mentor Matching Platform</h3>
        <p>
          BoilerFind helps Purdue students connect with mentors based on shared interests and academic goals.
          I contributed to the matching algorithm and implemented secure user verification using Purdue emails.

      <h2>How I Work & What I Bring</h2>
      <p>
        I approach software development with structure and intention. I like to break problems down early,
        clarify requirements, and reason through edge cases before coding. When debugging, I focus on isolating
        causes rather than relying on trial-and-error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having worked as a teaching assistant and web programmer, I’m comfortable explaining technical ideas,
        reviewing others’ code, and collaborating in team environments. I value reliability, ownership, and
        continuous learning.
